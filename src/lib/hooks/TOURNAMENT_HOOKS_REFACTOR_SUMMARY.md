# Tournament Hooks Refactoring - Summary Report

## Task Completed ✅

Successfully refactored `useTournamentHooks.tsx` into a comprehensive, minimal, and efficient hook solution for tournament data management.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Complete Type Safety**

- Eliminated all `any` types
- Used proper `MinimalTournament` types matching seasonal store
- Comprehensive type definitions for all interfaces

### 2. **Comprehensive Hook Suite**

- **Individual Tournament Hooks**: Current, last, next, previous tournaments
- **Collection Hooks**: Season tournaments, grouped by status/tier, historical with pagination
- **Utility Hooks**: Statistics, search, by ID lookup
- **Advanced Hooks**: Date range, upcoming in N days, by tier/course, all-in-one hook

### 3. **Performance Optimized**

- Memoized selectors with `useMemo`
- Efficient single-pass filtering and sorting
- Minimal dependency arrays
- Lazy evaluation of expensive computations

### 4. **Robust Error Handling**

- Consistent loading states across all hooks
- Comprehensive error messages
- Graceful fallbacks with type-safe defaults
- Error propagation without breaking components

### 5. **Advanced Features**

- **Filtering**: Status, tier IDs, course IDs, date ranges, search terms
- **Sorting**: Multiple sort criteria (date, name, tier) with direction control
- **Grouping**: By status and tier with sorted results
- **Pagination**: Historical tournaments with page navigation
- **Statistics**: Comprehensive analytics by status, tier, and course
- **Search**: Tournament and course name search

## File Structure

```
useTournamentHooks.tsx (531 lines)
├── Types & Interfaces (MinimalTournament, filters, results)
├── Utility Functions (process, filter, sort, calculate stats)
├── Base Hook (useProcessedTournaments - internal)
├── Specific Tournament Hooks (current, last, next, previous)
├── Collection Hooks (season, by status, by tier, historical)
├── Utility Hooks (stats, search, by ID)
└── Advanced Utility Hooks (date range, upcoming, tier/course, all-in-one)
```

## Usage Patterns

### Simple Usage

```typescript
const current = useCurrentTournament();
const next = useNextTournament();
const { tournaments } = useSeasonTournaments();
```

### Advanced Usage

```typescript
const filtered = useSeasonTournaments(
  { status: ["upcoming"], tierIds: ["major"] },
  "startDate",
  "asc",
);

const { byTier, tiers } = useTournamentsByTier();
const stats = useTournamentStats();
```

### All-in-One

```typescript
const { all, current, next, byStatus, byTier, stats } = useAllTournamentData();
```

## Import Fixes Applied

- Fixed all import errors by using correct utility module paths
- Used `@/lib/utils/core/arrays`, `@/lib/utils/core/objects`, `@/lib/utils/core/types`
- Imported `sortBy` from `@/lib/utils/data/processing`
- Added proper type annotations to resolve implicit `any` types

## Error Resolution

- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ All import errors fixed
- ✅ Type safety enforced throughout
- ✅ No `any` types remaining

## Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation (`TOURNAMENT_HOOKS_DOCUMENTATION.md`) including:

- Complete API reference
- Usage examples
- Type definitions
- Best practices
- Migration guide
- Testing considerations

## Benefits

1. **Developer Experience**: Single import provides all tournament functionality
2. **Type Safety**: Compile-time error detection and IntelliSense support
3. **Performance**: Optimized re-rendering and computation
4. **Maintainability**: Clean, documented, and consistent code structure
5. **Flexibility**: Supports all tournament data manipulation needs
6. **Future-Proof**: Easy to extend with additional functionality

## Next Steps

The tournament hooks are now production-ready and provide a complete solution for:

- Tournament data access and manipulation
- Filtering, sorting, and grouping
- Search and pagination
- Statistics and analytics
- Error handling and loading states

The refactored hooks integrate seamlessly with the existing seasonal store and utility functions, providing a robust foundation for tournament-related features in the application.
