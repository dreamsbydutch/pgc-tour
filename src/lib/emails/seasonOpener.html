    </div>
  
  <p>Season 5 of the PGC Tour has finally arrived and it is undoubtedly going to be the best one yet! As always, we get underway with one of the best tournaments on the PGA schedule, The Waste Management Open. The field has been set, the groups have been chosen, and it's finally time to <a href="https://www.pgctour.ca/tournament/cm50s1ug2000p84bsoe4i10jo" style="color:black" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pgctour.ca/tournament/cm50s1ug2000p84bsoe4i10jo&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1738733433304000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1y4QxE62eWI_F1frbYAvBA">make some picks.</a> This season we have just over 100 returning players, including the 2024 PGC Champion C. Dutchyshen, competing with 45 PGC tour rookies and we are nearly full. There are still 2 spots left on the CCG tour, let's fill those spots by Thursday's tee off!
</p>

  <p>The PGC Clubhouse has been completely rebuilt from the ground up for the 2025 season and it is an absolute gamechanger! The step up in user experience is huge. You can now add friends using the stars on the standings page and see them highlighted all across the app, you will see your team's golfers highlighted on the PGA leaderboard during tournaments, and there are so many new features to come with this app. Remember, make sure you have it saved to your phone's homepage by going to the website, pressing 'Share', and then 'Add to Home Screen'. This is by far the best way to access the PGC Clubhouse throughout the season.</p>
  
  <p>This season we have rebranded with the Coach Carter Golf tour playing alongside the Dreams by Dutch tour and we will see if the rivalry between Dutch and Carter heats&nbsp;up. Each tour will be giving out nearly $4,500 throughout the season and the title of 2025 PGC Champion comes along with a $1,500 prize. For those new to the league I recommend a quick look over the rulebook page in the clubhouse. It is short and sweet and will give you all the info you need.</p>
